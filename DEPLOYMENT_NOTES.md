# üöÄ TournamentPro Deployment Notes

## Changes Made for Render Deployment

### 1. Python Version Changed
**Issue**: Python 3.13 had compatibility issues with eventlet and other packages.
**Fix**: Switched to Python 3.10.14 in `runtime.txt` for better package compatibility.

### 2. Eventlet to Gevent Migration
**Issue**: Eventlet is incompatible with Python 3.13 due to removed `ssl.wrap_socket` function.
**Fix**: Switched from eventlet to gevent worker in Gunicorn and Flask-SocketIO configuration.

### 3. Image Processing Disabled
**Issue**: Pillow (PIL) package was causing build failures on Render due to missing wheels.

**Temporary Fix Applied**:
- Removed `Pillow==9.5.0` from `requirements.txt`
- Commented out `from PIL import Image` in `routes/media.py`
- Modified `process_uploaded_image()` function to skip processing

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ File uploads still work
- ‚úÖ All other app functionality preserved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Images won't be automatically resized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No image format conversion

### What Works Without Image Processing
- File uploads (images, videos, documents)
- File validation and security
- File serving and downloads
- Gallery display
- Tournament management
- User authentication
- Real-time features (SocketIO)
- All core functionality

### How to Re-enable Image Processing Later

Once the app is successfully deployed, you can re-enable image processing:

1. **Add Pillow back to requirements.txt**:
   ```
   Pillow==9.5.0
   ```

2. **Restore the import in routes/media.py**:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   ```

3. **Restore the full image processing function**:
   ```python
   def process_uploaded_image(file_path):
       """Process uploaded image (resize if too large)"""
       try:
           with Image.open(file_path) as img:
               # Convert to RGB if necessary
               if img.mode in ('RGBA', 'LA', 'P'):
                   img = img.convert('RGB')
               
               # Resize if image is too large
               max_size = (1920, 1080)
               if img.size[0] > max_size[0] or img.size[1] > max_size[1]:
                   img.thumbnail(max_size, Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
                   img.save(file_path, 'JPEG', quality=85, optimize=True)
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error processing image {file_path}: {e}")
   ```

4. **Deploy the updated version**

### Alternative Solutions to Try Later

1. **Use a different image processing library**:
   - `opencv-python-headless` (might have better wheel support)
   - `imageio` (lighter alternative)

2. **Use cloud-based image processing**:
   - Cloudinary
   - AWS Lambda with PIL layer
   - Supabase Edge Functions

3. **Build custom Docker image**:
   - Create Dockerfile with system dependencies
   - Pre-install Pillow with system libraries

## Current Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Core Flask app ready
- ‚úÖ SocketIO configured
- ‚úÖ Gunicorn production server
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity (Supabase)
- ‚úÖ File upload system (without processing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image processing temporarily disabled

The app should deploy successfully and be fully functional except for automatic image resizing.
